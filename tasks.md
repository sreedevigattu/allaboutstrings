# Setup
## What we'll learn
We will learn how to work with the *string operations* - **capitalize** and **concatenate** - in python. 
## Get the code
For this project, you'll download, complete and run the code on your local computer.
## Local Environment Setup
For this project, you will need *python (>3.3)* installed.
## Verify Local Environment
1. Run the following command and verify that python version is greater than 3.3
```
    python --version
    Python 3.x.y
```
2. After completing the code, 
    - Run *name.py* You should see *"Greta Thunberg"* as the output
    - Run *test\\testname.py* to check if there are any errors and reasons for the errors (if any)
    
# Capitalize and Concantenate strings
Variables *fname* and *lname* are already initialized to *"Greta"* and *"Thunberg"* respectively in the code.
1. Capitalize *fname* using the function **capitalize()** and store in *firstname*
2. Capitalize *lname* using the function **capitalize()** and store in *lastname*
3. Concatenate *firstname* and the *lastname* (with a space in between) using **+** operator and store in *fullname*
